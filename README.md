# Problem Solving - Stock Market

A stretch activity from Lighthouse Labs (W01D5)

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

In this exercise, we intend to find the biggest positive difference in a given array, taking into account the sequential order. If no profit is possible, -1 will be returned.

## Example

`[45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11]`

should return `16`

`[45, 35, 31, 28, 11]`

should return `-1`

## Algorythm

The Divide and Conquer technique was used.
